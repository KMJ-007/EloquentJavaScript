Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.

Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.

Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.

The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until it is declared:

```javascript
carName = "Volvo";
let carName;
```
ReferenceError
